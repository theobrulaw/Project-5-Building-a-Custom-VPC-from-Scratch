# Ubuntu Installation on VirtualBox

## Objective
Objective
By the end of this lab, you will:
Create and configure an S3 bucket for static website hosting.
Upload HTML and other website assets.
Make your site publicly accessible using Bucket Policies.
Test your site via the S3 website endpoint.
(Optional) Configure a custom domain using Amazon Route 53.

---

## Prerequisites

1. An AWS account (Free Tier eligible).
2. IAM user with AmazonS3FullAccess.
3. AWS CLI configured (aws configure).

A simple website folder on your local system:

 website/
├── index.html
└── error.html
Example content for testing:
 index.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Welcome to My S3 Website</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>Hello from S3!</h1>
    <p>This website is hosted entirely on Amazon S3.</p>
  </body>
</html>

error.html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head><title>Page Not Found</title></head>
  <body>
    <h1>404 - Page Not Found</h1>
    <p>Sorry, the page you requested does not exist.</p>
  </body>
</html>

## Steps Performed

### Step 1: Create an S3 Bucket
Using AWS Console:
1. Go to the Amazon S3 Console.
2. Click “Create bucket”.

Enter a unique bucket name:
 my-static-website-damian
3. ⚠️ Bucket names must be globally unique and DNS-compliant.
4. Choose your AWS region (e.g., us-east-1).
5. Uncheck “Block all public access” since websites need to be publicly accessible.
6. Confirm the warning and proceed.
7. Click Create bucket.

---

### Step 2: Upload Website Files
1. Click your newly created bucket.
2. Select Upload → Add files.
3. Upload both:
-index.html
-error.html
4. Click Upload.

Your files will now appear in the bucket.

---

### 3. Attach Ubuntu ISO
- Select the VM → **Settings**
- Go to **Storage**
- Attach the Ubuntu Server ISO to the optical drive

---

### 4. Install Ubuntu
- Start the VM
- Select language and keyboard layout
- Configure networking (default DHCP via NAT)
- Skip proxy unless required
- Use default mirror settings
- Partition disk using guided setup
- Create:
  - Username
  - Strong password
- Select OpenSSH server during installation
- Complete installation and reboot
- Remove ISO when prompted

---

### 5. Log In and Update System
After reboot, log in and run:

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y
# Lab Title

## Objective
Briefly describe what this lab demonstrates and why it matters in a real-world
cloud, DevOps, or security context.

## Architecture / Environment Overview
Describe the environment, services, VMs, networking mode, or cloud components
used in this lab.

## Prerequisites
- Tools required
- Accounts or access needed
- Prior knowledge assumed

## Steps Performed
1. Step-by-step actions taken
2. Commands executed or configurations applied
3. Key decisions or trade-offs made

## Validation & Verification
Successful installation is confirmed by:
- System boots without errors
- User can log in locally
- Network interface receives an IP address
- Internet connectivity confirmed via package updates
- Ubuntu version and kernel information displayed correctly

Optional validation:
- SSH access enabled
- Snapshot created in VirtualBox for rollback

## Security & Operational Considerations
- A non-root user account is used with sudo privileges
- System packages are fully updated
- SSH service enabled for remote access (to be hardened in later labs)
- NAT networking limits exposure to external networks
- Snapshots provide quick recovery and change tracking

## Lessons Learned
- Ubuntu installation is straightforward but requires attention to resource
  allocation for smooth performance
- Enabling SSH during installation simplifies remote management
- NAT networking is ideal for early labs due to simplicity and isolation
- Creating a clean baseline VM makes future labs faster and more consistent

This Ubuntu VM will serve as the base system for networking, security
hardening, automation, and cloud-related exercises.
